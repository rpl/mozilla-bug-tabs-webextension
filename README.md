mozilla-bug-tabs-webextension
=============================


Just a small personal webextension, I created it some time ago as a VueJS-based test extension,
I have never really completed it, nevertheless I'm actually using it :-)

The extension provides a (very simple and not particularly beautiful) sidebar extension page
which lists all the bugzilla and mozreview tabs grouped by Bugzilla issue number
(and filter out everything else).
